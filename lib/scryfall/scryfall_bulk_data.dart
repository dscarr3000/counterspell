/// Scryfall provides daily exports of our card data in bulk files.
/// Each of these files is represented as a bulk_data object via the API.
/// URLs for files change their timestamp each day, and can be [fetched programmatically](https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data/all).
///
/// Please note:
///
/// - Card objects in bulk data include price information, but prices should be
/// considered dangerously stale after 24 hours.
/// Only use bulk price information to track trends or provide a general estimate of card value.
/// Prices are not updated frequently enough to power a storefront or sales system.
/// You consume price information at your own risk.
/// - Updates to gameplay data (such as card names, Oracle text, mana costs, etc) are much less frequent.
/// If you only need gameplay information, downloading card data once per week or right
/// after set releases would most likely be sufficient.
/// - Every card type in every product is included, including
/// [planar cards](https://scryfall.com/search?q=t%3Aplane+or+t%3Aphenom),
/// [schemes](https://scryfall.com/search?q=t%3Ascheme), [Vanguard cards](https://scryfall.com/search?q=t%3Avanguard),
/// [tokens](https://scryfall.com/search?q=t%3Atoken), [emblems](https://scryfall.com/search?q=t%3Aemblem),
/// and [funny cards](https://scryfall.com/search?q=is%3Afunny).
/// Make sure youâ€™ve reviewed [documentation for the Card type](https://scryfall.com/docs/api/cards).
///
/// Bulk data is only collected once every 12 hours. You can use the card API methods to retrieve fresh objects instead.
